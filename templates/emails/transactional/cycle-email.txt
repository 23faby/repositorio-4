Hi {{name}}

SimpleLogin has blocked an email that was sent to your alias {{alias.email}} from its mailbox {{ mailbox.email }}:
    the email would be forwarded to the same mailbox {{ mailbox.email }}.

This creates a *cycle* and the email will probably be refused or hidden by your email service anyway.

You can view this email here:
{{ refused_email_url }}

The email is automatically deleted in 7 days.

Please let us know if you have any question.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
