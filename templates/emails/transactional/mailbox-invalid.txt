Hi {{name}}

We have detected that your mailbox {{ mailbox.email }} cannot receive emails as it's a SimpleLogin alias.

A mailbox needs to be a "final" email address and cannot be an email alias.

Please update this mailbox to a non-alias email address on
{{ mailbox_url }}

Feel free reply to this email if you have any question.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
