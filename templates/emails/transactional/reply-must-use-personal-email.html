    We have recorded an attempt to send an email from your alias <b>{{ alias.email }}</b> using <b>{{ sender }}</b>.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Please note that sending from this alias only works from one of these mailboxes: <br>
    {% for mailbox in alias.mailboxes %}
      - {{ mailbox.email }} <br>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    This is to protect against "email spoofing", i.e. someone else sending emails from your mailbox. <br>
    Indeed only you can send emails on behalf of your alias. <br>
    If you think this is a wrong alert, please let us know by replying to this email.
  {% endcall %}

    Thanks, <br/>
