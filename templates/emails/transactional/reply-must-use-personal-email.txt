Hi {{name}}

We have recorded an attempt to send an email from your alias {{ alias.email }} using {{ sender }}.

Please note that sending from this alias only works from one of these mailboxes:

{% for mailbox in alias.mailboxes %}
- {{mailbox.email}}
{% endfor %}

This is to protect against "email spoofing", i.e. someone else sending emails from your mailbox.
If {{ sender }} can indeed send emails from your alias, you can add it to the allow list on {{authorize_address_link}}
If you think this is a wrong alert, please let us know by replying to this email.


Best,
SimpleLogin team.
