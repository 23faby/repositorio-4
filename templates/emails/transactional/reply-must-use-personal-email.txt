Hi {{name}}

We have recorded an attempt to send an email from your alias {{ alias.email }} using {{ sender }}.

Please note that sending from this alias only works from one of these mailboxes:

{% for mailbox in alias.mailboxes %}
- {{mailbox.email}}
{% endfor %}

This is to protect against "email spoofing", i.e. someone else sending emails from your mailbox.
Indeed only you can send emails on behalf of your alias.
If you think this is a wrong alert, please let us know by replying to this email.


Best,
SimpleLogin team.
