Hi {{name}}

We have recorded an attempt to send an email from your alias {{ alias.email }} using {{ sender }}.

Please note that sending from this alias only works from one of these mailboxes:

{% for mailbox in alias.mailboxes %}
- {{mailbox.email}}
{% endfor %}


Indeed only you can send emails on behalf of your alias.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
