Hi {{name}}

There are at least 2 emails sent to your alias {{alias}} from {{website_from}} that have been refused (or bounced) by your email provider.

This is usually due to the email being considered as spam by your email provider.
The email is included at the end of this message so you can take a look at its content.

As security measure, we have disabled the alias {{alias}}.

Please let us know if you have any question.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
