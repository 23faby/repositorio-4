Hi {{name}}

There are at least 2 emails sent to your alias {{alias}} from {{website_from}} that have been refused (or bounced) by your email provider.

This is usually due to the email being considered as spam by your email provider.
You can view this email here:
{{ refused_email_url }}


As security measure, we have disabled the alias {{alias}}.

Please let us know if you have any question.

Best,
