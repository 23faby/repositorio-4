Hi {{name}}!

This is Son, SimpleLogin Founder ðŸ˜Š.

Even though I lead the company, Iâ€™m the "product person" and the user experience you get from our product means a lot to me.

Our users and developers love SimpleLogin and its simplicity (hence the "simple" in the name ðŸ˜‰), but if there's anything that's bugging you, even the smallest of issues that could be done better, I want to hear about it - so hit the reply button.

And ok, this is an automated email, but if you reply it comes directly to me and will be answered by me.

Thanks!
Son - SimpleLogin founder.
