    When creating an alias, you can choose the mailbox that <b>owns</b> this alias, meaning: <br>
    1. Emails sent to this alias are forwarded to the owning mailbox. <br>
    2. The owning mailbox can send or reply emails from this alias.

    A mailbox doesn't have to be <b>your</b> email address: you can also create aliases for your friend by adding
    his/her email address as your mailbox.
