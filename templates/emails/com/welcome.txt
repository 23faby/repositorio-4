Hi {{name}}

My name is Son. Iâ€™m the founder of SimpleLogin and I wanted to be the first to welcome you on board.

To better secure your account, I recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on your setting page at
https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/setting

SimpleLogin browser extension could be handy to quickly manage aliases.

Chrome (or other Chromium-based browsers like Brave or Vivaldi) extension can be installed on:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplelogin-your-anti-spa/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn

Firefox on
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/simplelogin/

and Safari on
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplelogin/id1494051017?mt=12&fbclid=IwAR0M0nnEKgoieMkmx91TSXrtcScj7GouqRxGgXeJz2un_5ydhIKlbAI79Io

If you have a domain, for example for your business or your project, you can import your domain into SimpleLogin
and create your business emails backed by your personal email! By the way, all our business emails are actually aliases.

If you use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), you can import your public key into SimpleLogin and all emails will be encrypted
before being forwarded to your mailbox. You can add your PGP key in "Mailbox" tab on
https://app.simplelogin.io/dashboard/mailbox

{% if user.in_trial() %}
You can use all premium features like custom domain or alias directory during the trial period.
Your trial will end {{ user.trial_end.humanize() }}.
All aliases you create during the trial will continue to work normally when the trial ends.
{% endif %}

If there's anything that's bugging you, even the smallest of issues that could be done better, I want to hear about it - so hit the reply button.


Thanks.
SimpleLogin Team.
